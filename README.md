# Foundations of Data Science
This repository contains materials and projects for my Foundations of Data Science course.
The course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of data science. 
I will explore datasets, Jupyter notebooks with code examples and exercises, completed data science projects, and reports on data analysis and findings are included.
